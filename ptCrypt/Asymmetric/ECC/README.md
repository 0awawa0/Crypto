# ECC

This module is dedicated for elliptic curve cryptography implementation, although it does not contain any particular algorithms yet.

There is, however, [Curve](./Curve.py) file that contains implementation of elliptic curve calculations that are used for Lenstra factorization in [primality](../../Math/primality.py) module.
