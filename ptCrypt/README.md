# ptCrypt

The toplevel project structure consists of several modules. Each module also might be divided into submodules, submodules might be divided into sub-submodules and so on. Each module folder will contain README file explaining its structure and functions.

Top level modules:

+ [Asymmetric](./Asymmetric/README.md) - contains asymmetric encryption algorithms implementations.

+ [Symmetric](./Symmetric/README.md) - contains symmetric encryption algorithms implementations.

+ [Attacks](./Attacks//README.md) - contains implementations of attacks on algorithms. Module contains both symmetric and asymmetric algorithms.

+ [Math](./Math/README.md) - contains helpful mathematic algorithms, such as GCD, EGCD, primality checks etc.

+ [Util](./Util/README.md) - contains some additional data and functions.
